// basic approach - steps
// algorithm - process or steps to accomplish task
1. understand the problem
 - restate problem
 - inputs > outputs
 - labelling

2. concrete examples
 - testing, sanity checks
 - simple examples > complex examples
 - empty/invalid inputs

3. breaking down
 - communicate, provide hints/guide interviewer
 - explicitly write out steps
 - catch lingering issues, declare naming/syntax
 - pseudo-code, formulate approach clearly and gain benefit of doubt

4. solve a simpler problem
 - find core difficulty
 - temporarily ignore difficulty

5. look back and refactor
 - derive differently
 - readability
 - performance concerns
 - styling/structures
 - existing solutions, pick their brain

// patterns
